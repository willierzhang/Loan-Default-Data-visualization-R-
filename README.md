For most lending industries such as Lending Club and Sallie Mae, also known as P2P lenders, they use online trading platforms as lending channels, undisturbed by traditional financial intermediaries such as Banks. P2P platforms have become popular recently due to the face that it reduces funding costs, and it also brings higher profitability to both borrowers and lenders. Borrowers benefit from lower interest rates; lenders get a higher return than they get from the bank, and a better rate of return can be efficiently calculated. However, in small loans, assessing the credit of loan applicants is a common challenge, and loans are usually unsecured. Companies wanting to be profitable not only require a certain number of customer groups but a way to predict the customer payment status and reduce potential risk are important indicators of sustainable profitability. Therefore, the purpose of our project is to determine whether the applicant's loan can be approved, eventually to use a logistic regression model to maximize the correct classification of potential and non-defaulters.
